# Hotel Revenue Data Analysis with Power BI

This Project shows a visual data story and dashboard created using **Power BI** to present hotel revenue insights to stakeholders. We'll address the following questions through our analysis:

## 1. Is Our Hotel Revenue Growing by Year?
We'll explore the overall trend in hotel revenue over time. Since we have two hotel types, we'll also segment the revenue by hotel type. Here's a step-by-step approach to finding the solution:

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Gather historical revenue data for both hotel types.
   - Clean and preprocess the data (handle missing values, outliers, etc.).

2. **Visualization**:
   - Create line charts or bar graphs to visualize revenue trends over the years.
   - Compare revenue growth between the two hotel types.

3. **Insights**:
   - Identify any significant growth or decline in revenue.
   - Analyze seasonality patterns (if any).

## 2. Should We Increase Our Parking Lot Size?
We want to understand if there's a trend in guests with personal cars. To investigate parking space requirements, follow these steps:

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Collect data on guest arrivals and their mode of transportation (personal car, public transport, etc.).

2. **Analysis**:
   - Calculate the percentage of guests arriving with personal cars.
   - Compare this percentage over time (monthly or yearly).

3. **Recommendation**:
   - If the trend shows an increasing number of guests with personal cars, consider expanding the parking lot.

## 3. What Trends Can We See in the Data?
Let's focus on the following aspects:

1. **Average Daily Rate (ADR)**:
   - Visualize ADR trends over time.
   - Identify any seasonal patterns (e.g., peak seasons, off-peak seasons).

2. **Guests**:
   - Explore the number of guests over time.
   - Look for any patterns related to events, holidays, or seasons.

Remember to create compelling visualizations using Power BI to communicate these insights effectively to stakeholders. Happy analyzing! 📊🏨
